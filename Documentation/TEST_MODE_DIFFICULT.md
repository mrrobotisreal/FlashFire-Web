## Description
When you choose the easy test mode from the *Choose A Mode* menu, it is very similar to the study mode. Again a timestamp is taken in order to update the *last tested* display, and you are also presented with almost the exact same screen as the [study mode](https://github.com/mrrobotisreal/FlashFire-Web/blob/main/Documentation/STUDY_MODE.md). The *show stats* button and timer work the exact same way as the study mode, with the exception that stats are shown as percentage grades instead of points.

The difficult test mode functions nearly the same as the [easy mode](https://github.com/mrrobotisreal/FlashFire-Web/blob/main/Documentation/TEST_MODE_EASY.md), with the exception of a couple of key differences. In this description I will only highlight the differences from the easy test mode, so if you need to reference it please click the *easy mode* link above.

Like the easy test mode, you are unable to reveal the answer to any of the questions, and you are presented with multiple choice answers and a *Check Answer* button, with your grade reflected beneath it in real time. The key difference is that in the difficult mode you are presented with 6 multiple choice answers (a,b,c,d,e,f). It's important to note that like the easy test mode, you can only participate in the difficult test mode if you have 6 or more cards for the algorithm to work properly when generating random answers. You can select an answer and it will highlight in purple, but if you've selected the correct answer and you check it, it will only display a bright green outline around your answer if it's correct. On the other hand, if you've selected the incorrect answer, then when you check it will only show a bright red outline around the answer you chose. None of the other answers will be highlighted. This is what constitutes the "difficult" part of this mode, because there are more answers to choose from and you are not shown the correct answer when you get it wrong.
