## Description
If you click the *Create A New Collection* button from the main menu, it will take you to another screen where you can create the collection. There are a few sections on this screen, beginning with 2 inputs to create a name for this collection and then to give it a category.

Beneath this section is a box where the cards will be added. This box contains an option to choose an image file from your device, but this is optional and not required. Next is a text area where you can write your question for the card, and then a text area underneath to write the answer to the card. At the bottom of this box is an *Add Card* button. When you add a card it will increment in real time so you know how many cards you have in the collection you're creating. You can create and add as many cards to the collection as you wish, and you can also create as many collections as you wish.

Finally at the very bottom you have a button to *Finish Collection* and a *Main Menu* button. Just like when using the study or testing modes, clicking *Finish Collection* is the ONLY way to save your new collection, and clicking the *Main Menu* button will take you back to the main menu without saving the collection or cards.
