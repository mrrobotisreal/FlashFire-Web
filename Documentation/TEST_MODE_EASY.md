## Description
When you choose the easy test mode from the *Choose A Mode* menu, it is very similar to the study mode. Again a timestamp is taken in order to update the *last tested* display, and you are also presented with almost the exact same screen as the [study mode](https://github.com/mrrobotisreal/FlashFire-Web/blob/main/Documentation/STUDY_MODE.md). The *show stats* button and timer work the exact same way as the study mode, with the exception that stats are shown as percentage grades instead of points.

The key difference between the study modes and test modes, are the fact that in the easy test mode you do not have the option to reveal the answer to the question. Instead, you are presented with 4 multiple choice answers (a,b,c,d). The multiple choice answers are generated randomly from the other cards in the collection and there is always guaranteed to be one choice that is the correct answer. It's important to note that if you create a flashcard collection that has less than 4 cards you will not be allowed to participate in the easy test mode. This is because the algorithm needs at least 4 cards to pull the other answers from. The recommended amount of cards per collection in order to particpate in all modes is 10 or more flashcards though. Beneath the multiple choice answers is a *Check Answer* button, which will verify whether or not your selected answer is correct, and your grade will be displayed underneath in real time as you answer questions.

When you select one of the answers, you will see a purple outline around the answer denoting that you have selected it, and if you choose another answer then that answer will be highlighted and the previous answer will no longer be highlighted. If you select the correct answer, and the click the *Check Answer* button you will see a bright green outline around the correct answer and all of the incorrect answers will be highlighted in bright red. The significance of this is best understood when an incorrect answer is selected when you check the answer. If you select the incorrect answer and check it, all of the incorrect answers will be highlighted in bright red and the correct answer will be highlighted in bright green. This is what constitutes the "easy" part of the test mode.
