## Description
When study mode is selected from the *Choose A Mode* menu for a particular collection, it creates a time stamp to update the *last studied* display, and then brings you to the study mode screen. This screen consists of a *show stats* button at the time, which pops up a modal displaying your study mode stats for this collection. Beneath that is a timer that you can optionally set either with the up and down arrows on the right, or you can directly type in a time in the same area where the time is displayed. It's important to note that it uses minutes as a measure of time, so if you wanted to only study for 30 seconds, you would have to manually type .5 and then it would work. Once the timer is started you will be presented with a timer counting down by seconds, and underneath you will have *pause*, *resume* and *restart* buttons. It's also important to note that if your current score is greater than your previous score when the timer ends, you will see confetti fall down the screen and a message congratulating you on beating your previous score with your current score.

Beneath the show stats button and the timer is where the real meat and potatoes are for study mode. Inside of the box you will first see *Card n of x* where x represents the total number of cards in the collection and n represents the current card you are viewing. Below that is another box containing the question at the top, and directly beneath it is the *reveal* button. When this button is clicked it will reveal the answer between the question and the reveal button. Underneath that section are two buttons, one containing a red 'x' on the left and on the right is a green checkmark. Currently the red 'x' button isn't used for anything, I am in the process of changing up how the points system works. The green checkmark button, however, does work and is used to give yourself a point for each card you get correct. Finally at the bottom, we have 'Previous Score' and below that is a number denoting whatever your previous score is from the last time you completed a study session.

Below everything previously listed, are the *Finish* button, *Main Menu* button, and then left and right arrow buttons. Clicking on the *Finish* button is the ONLY way to save your score for the current study session, if you click *Main Menu* it will simply take you back to the main menu and not save your score. It's important to note that if your current score is greater than your previous score when the *Finish* button is clicked, you will see confetti fall down the screen and a modal congratulating you for beating your previous score with your current score. The left and right arrow buttons simply either move you to the previous or next card respectively, but there are also preset hotkeys to do the same if you press the left arrow key or the right arrow key.
