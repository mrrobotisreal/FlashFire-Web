## Description
While viewing the main menu, you can click the View Stats button which will pop up a modal containing the stats for whichever collection is currently selected on the main menu. When viewing that main menu stats modal for a particular collection, you will notice that there are 3 charts. The first chart displays your stats from all study mode sessions you've completed for this collection, the second chart displays your stats from all easy test mode sessions you've completed for this collection, and the final chart displays your stats from all difficult test mode sessions you've completed for this collection.

When you have entered a study mode session, you can click the show stats button at the top which will pop up a modal containing your highest score of all time for this collection, your most recent score, and your average score. Below those specific details is a line chart showing each one of your scores from every time you have studied this particular collection. It's important to note that scores are only saved when the *Finish* button is clicked, NOT when the *Main Menu* button is clicked, and this is true of all modes including testing modes.

To view your stats for both the easy test mode and the difficult test mode, you can follow the same procedure I outlined above. The only difference is that test modes display percentage grades instead of point scores. For example, if you had 4 cards in study mode and you got 3 correct, you would see 3 points, but in either test mode you would see 75% in the stats instead. Both test modes also display in a similar fashion with a highest grade, most recent grade, and average grade directly above a line chart showing each one of your scores from every time you've tested yourself.
