## Description
### Login / Signup
The demo I have posted above displays the login/signup screen and the main menu. If you do not have an account, then you can register to sign up for a free account and all passwords are encrypted before they are stored. If you already have an account you can of course choose to just log in, and whether you are signing up or logging in this application uses cookies to keep track of user sessions, for ease of use without needing to log in every time you want to study.

### Main Menu
Once logged in you are taken to the main menu, which consists of 3 main sections and a log out button at the very bottom. The first section, which is the main section at the top, is where your collections can be viewed and the number at the top displays how many collections you currently have. Only one collection is displayed at a time (this may be subject to change, and if it is, I will update this README accordingly), and it displays when the collection was originally created and the last time it was viewed, regardless of what mode it was viewed in *see flashcard modes section for more details*. You can browse through your collections with the up and down arrow buttons located directly above and below the current collection being displayed.

The next section, which is below the listed collections, contains the 'View <name-of-collection> Stats'. Clicking on the 'View <name-of-collection> Stats' button will pop up a modal onto the topmost part of the screen. This modal will contain 3 different charts displaying your stats for the current collection. The first chart displays your stats for the *Study Mode*, the second displays yours stats for *Test Mode (Easy)*, and the third and final chart displays your stats for *Test Mode (Difficult)*.

The final section, which is below the 'View <name-of-collectioni> Stats' button, contains the 'Create New Collection' button. Clicking on this button will bring you to another screen where you can create a new collection. This screen is composed of 3 main sections as well. There is a section at the very top containing an input area to create a name for the collection you wish to create, and another input below that where you can also create a category for the collection. The next section is a separate box, which is where the new flashcards will be added. This section is composed of an optional input to choose an image to add to the card at the top, below that is a text area to write the *Question* part of the card, naturally below that is the text area to write the *Answer* part of the card, and finally at the very bottom is a button to add the card and a 'Total Cards: 0' display which increments as cards are added. You can create as many collections as you wish, and you can add as many cards as you wish to each of those collections. The last section of the Create New Collection screen, which is below the Add Cards box, contains 2 buttons: *Finish Collection* and *Main Menu*. To finish the collection you've just created and save it, press the *Finish Collection* button and after it is saved you will return to the main menu, and to cancel creating the new collection click the *Main Menu* button which will not save the collection and still return you to the main menu.
